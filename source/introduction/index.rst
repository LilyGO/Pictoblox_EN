PictoBlox is a graphical programming software based on Scratch 3.0, and is an ideal companion to the first step in the programming world.
Its user-friendly interface and drag-and-drop function eliminate the need to store syntax and rules, which is often encountered in traditional programming languages,
And often make children feel afraid and make them hesitate. As a result, they only need to focus on the problem at hand and develop skills such as logical reasoning and problem solving,
This is an essential skill in today's technology-driven world.

.. note::
  Scratch is a computer program development platform developed by MIT,
  Designed to enable beginners of programming languages to design products without having to learn language grammar first.
  Developers expect to learn Scratch,
  Inspire and motivate users to learn programming, mathematics and computing knowledge through operations (such as designing interactive stories) in a pleasant environment,
  At the same time get creative thinking, logic programming, and collaborative working experience.
